### 1. Web Frontend Engineer

This is the easiest entry point when joining tech world. - it is all about building user interfaces for websites.
The technologies to pick up here are, HTML, css, and javascript.

After fully grasping these three, you could go agead and learn new frameworks:
Javacsript frameworks which include Angular, ReactJS,NextJS,Vue JS

With one technology , you are in a good position to land a job in tech without any knowledge in backend.
and TailWind CSS, Bootstrap

### 2. Web Backend Engineer

Most universities teach students JAVA, C, or C++ which could be a starting point for a beginner to becoming a backend engineer.

This however, could limit you as most companies do not use these languages that much. The likes of facebook, microsoft and other big tech companies are moving inot using python and php for their backend languages.
In this case, pick up python language, php and nodejs and you are good to go.

### 3. Web Fullstack Engineer

This is where you combine both frontend and backend skills. Which is more excellent and it gives you more optons as you look for jobs in tech. 

If you can develop a website from backend to frontend then you are pretty much good to go.
The technologies to use here are combining html,css, javascript for frontend and python for backend. You can as well go ahead to use javascript and python frameworks.

You dont need to pick all frameworks at a go. Lately, there aere many frameworks out here. My advice here is you could pick one frontend framework and one backend framework and be good at it. For example, you could do NextJS for frontend and use Django (python framework) for the backend. This is pretty much it, you get to learn these two and you're good to go.

Additionally, frameworks are building blocks for these laguages.Therefore,make sure you fully understand python ad javascript before jumping into their frameworks.

To add to the fullstack knowledge, get to know about databases i.e myQSL.

***also web is here to stay and its pretty much in high demand.***

### 4. Mobile Engineer - Android/iOS

Suprisingly, this category has  the largest number  of engineers.Mobile engineering is big that it has surpassed desktop usage by far.

This field is a pretty much good entry point into tech in that if you pick one path to it, either Android or IOS and become pretty good at it, then you are good to go.You don't need any web-languges  or database knowledge to build mobile applications.

If you're into Android - pick Kotlin or Java.
if youre into IOS, pick Swift or Objective C.

I believe its the easiest objective path becaue all you need to learn is one language and you are good to go.
so go build apps, launch them on google play store or appstore, you never know, it could be the next uber/twitter/instgram.
